# CSMA-CD-Algorithm
The CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) algorithm is used in detecting collisions in Local Area network.
There are three parts in the project.
The first part is a simple network with two hosts connected to the same bus.
The second part has more than two hosts connected to the same bus.
The third part has 4 routers and 4 hosts connected as a WAN.
